;;; Commentary:

;; This package makes it easier to make subthemes.  If you like the
;; jde faces of theme A, the erc faces from theme B, and generally
;; prefer theme color-theme-gray30, then proceed as follows:

;; Install theme A, call M-x color-theme-maker, provide "jde" as
;; regexp and "my-jde-subtheme" as name, then install theme B, call
;; M-x color-theme-maker, provide "erc" as regexp and
;; "my-erc-subtheme" as name.  Save the two buffers as
;; my-jde-subtheme.el and my-erc-subtheme.el.  In your .emacs, add:
;;
;;   (require 'color-theme)
;;   (color-theme-gray30)
;;   (setq color-theme-is-cumulative t)
;;   (require 'my-jde-subtheme)
;;   (my-jde-subtheme)
;;   (require 'my-erc-subtheme)
;;   (my-erc-subtheme)
