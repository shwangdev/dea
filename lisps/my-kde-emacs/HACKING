Rules are simple:
1) Make sure that your functions work both on GNU/Emacs and XEmacs.
2) Put general variables in kde-emacs-vars.el, file related variables 
inside the related file.
3) Export general functions to kde-emacs-general.el.
4) Always provide documentation for both variables and functions that
you're adding.
