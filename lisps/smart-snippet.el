;;; Commentary:

;; Do you feel that the emace abbrev expansion is not smart enough?
;; Expansion to code snippet should not happen in comment. And
;; sometimes the same abbrev have different meaning. e.g. in ruby,
;; <--------------------
;; if
;; -------------------->
;; should expand into
;; <--------------------
;; if cond
;;
;; end
;; -------------------->
;; but the "if" at the follow statement
;; <--------------------
;; puts "foo" if predicate
;; -------------------->
;; should not expand to anything.
;;
;; So I write this code trying to solve this problem. It require the
;; wonderful snippet.el.

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'smart-snippet)
;; On how to define a conditional snippet, refer to the document of
;; `smart-snippet-abbrev' and `smart-snippet-with-abbrev-table'

;;; Tips:

;; If the indentation is incorrect, e.g: the following snippet for c++
;; will not indent correctly
;;
;; (smart-snippet-with-abbrev-table 'c++-mode-abbrev-table
;;   ("class"
;;    "class $${name}
;; {$>
;; public:$>
;;     $${name}()$>
;;     {$>
;;        $>$.
;;     }$>
;; };$>"
;;    'bol?))
;;
;; when expanded, it will become something like this:
;;
;; class foo
;; {
;; public:
;;     foo()
;;             {
;;
;;                     }
;; };
;;
;; This is because indentation is done when there are still
;; "garbage" text like "$" and "{" which can make Emacs confused.
;; The solution is to reassign the identifiers to something
;; else(it is buffer-local, so you can set it to different value
;; in a mode-hook according to different major-mode):
;;
;;  (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook
;;    (lambda ()
;;      (setq snippet-field-default-beg-char ?\()
;;      (setq snippet-field-default-end-char ?\))
;;      (setq snippet-exit-identifier "$;")))
;;
;;  (smart-snippet-with-abbrev-table 'c++-mode-abbrev-table
;;    ("class"
;;     "class $$(name)
;;  {$>
;;  public:$>
;;      $$(name)()$>
;;      {$>
;;         $>$;
;;      }$>
;;  };$>"
;;     'bol?))
;;
;; This will work fine. And you can choose appropriate characters
;; for different major-mode(language).
;; ***NOTE*** I'm modifying `snippet-insert' in snippet.el since
;; there're some bugs in it. The current version already don't need
;; this tricky things any more(but you can still use it).

;;; Implementation Notes:

;; `snippet-insert' from snippet.el is used to insert snippet.  In
;; order to allow multiple meaning of abbrev(i.e. the same abbrev
;; might expand to different thing under different condition), I
;; maintain a list of (condition . template) in a distinct variable
;; for distincting mode(e.g. smart-snippet-ruby-mode-snippets) , those
;; added later will come to the first of the list. When an abbrev is
;; triggered, the list is searched, the first snippet whose condition
;; is satisfied is then expanded. If no snippet is satisfied, expand
;; nothing(just insert a space).

;; In order to do some enhancement and bugfix, I decide to copy the
;; code of snippet.el and paste it here -- and do some modification
;; of courses. Since snippet.el is distributed under GPL, I can
;; modify and re-distribute it (smart-snippet.el is also GPLed).
;; Thanks to GPL! And thanks to Pete Kazmier(the author of snippet.el)
;; smart-snippet.el will be a fork of snippet.el. I think the
;; modification will be easier to do and the user will no longer
;; to download two separate files to use smart-snippet

;; Version: 0.2
;; Author: Pete Kazmier

;; A quick stab at providing a simple template facility like the one
;; present in TextMate (an OSX editor).  The general idea is that a
;; snippet of text (called a template) is inserted into a buffer
;; (perhaps triggered by an abbrev), and while the point is within the
;; snippet, a special keymap is active to permit the user to cycle the
;; point to any of the defined fields (placeholders) within the
;; template via `snippet-next-field' and `snippet-prev-field'.

;; For example, the following template might be a useful while editing
;; HTML:

;;   <a href="$$">$$</a>

;; This template might be useful for python developers.  In this
;; example, reasonable defaults have been supplied:

;;   for $${element} in $${sequence}:
;;       match = $${regexp}.search($${element})

;; When a template is inserted into a buffer (could be triggered by an
;; abbrev expansion, or simply bound to some key), point is moved to
;; the first field denoted by the "$$" characters (configurable via
;; `snippet-field-identifier').  The optional default for a field is
;; specified by the "{default}" (the delimiters are configurable via
;; `snippet-field-default-beg-char' and `snippet-field-defaul-end-char'.

;; If present, the default will be inserted and highlighted.  The user
;; then has the option of accepting the default by simply tabbing over
;; to the next field (any other key bound to `snippet-next-field' in
;; `snippet-map' can be used).  Alternatively, the user can start
;; typing their own value for the field which will cause the default
;; to be immediately replaced with the user's own input.  If two or
;; more fields have the same default value, they are linked together
;; (changing one will change the other dynamically as you type).

;; `snippet-next-field' (bound to <tab> by default) moves the point to
;; the next field.  `snippet-prev-field' (bound to <S-tab> by default)
;; moves the point to the previous field.  When the snippet has been
;; completed, the user simply tabs past the last field which causes
;; the snippet to revert to plain text in a buffer.  The idea is that
;; snippets should get out of a user's way as soon as they have been
;; filled and completed.

;; After tabbing past all of the fields, point is moved to the end of
;; the snippet, unless the user has specified a place within the
;; template with the `snippet-exit-identifier' ("$." by default).  For
;; example:

;;   if ($${test} {
;;       $.
;;   }

;; Indentation can be controlled on a per line basis by including the
;; `snippet-indent' string within the template.  Most often one would
;; include this at the beginning of a line; however, there are times
;; when indentation is better performed in other parts of the line.
;; The following shows how to use the functionality:

;;   if ($${test}) {
;;   $>this line would be indented
;;   this line will be indented after being inserted$>
;;   }

;;; Usage:

;; Snippets are inserted with the `snippet-insert' function.  This
;; function inserts the snippet into the current buffer.  It expects a
;; single argument which is the template that is to be inserted.  For
;; example:

;;   (snippet-insert "for $${element} in $${sequence}:")

;; `snippet-insert' can be called interactively in which case the user
;; is prompted for the template to insert.  This is hardly useful at
;; all unless you are testing the functionality of this code.

;; Snippets are much more effective when they are bound to expansions
;; for abbreviations.  When binding a snippet to an abbreviation, it
;; is important that you disable the insertion of the character that
;; triggered the expansion (typically some form of whitespace).  For
;; example, this is what you should NOT do:

;;   (define-abbrev python-mode-abbrev-table  ; abbrev table
;;                  "for"                     ; name
;;                  ""                        ; expansion
;;                  '(lambda ()               ; expansion hook
;;                     (snippet-insert
;;                      "for $${element} in $${sequence}:")))

;; The above example does not work as expected because after the
;; expansion hook is called, the snippet is inserted, and the point is
;; moved to the first field.  The problem occurs because when the user
;; typed "f o r <Spc>", the "<Spc>" character is inserted after the
;; snippet has been inserted.  The point happens to be located at the
;; first field and thus the "<Spc>" will delete any field default that
;; was present.

;; Fortunately, this is easy to fix.  According to the documentation
;; for `define-abbrev', if the hook function is a symbol whose
;; `no-self-insert' property is non-nil, then hook can control whether
;; or not the insertion of the character that triggered the abbrev
;; expansion is inserted.  `insert-snippet' returns non-nil and thus
;; the proper way of defining the abbrev is as follows:

;;   (defun python-foo-expansion ()
;;     (snippet-insert "for $${element} in $${sequence}:"))

;;   (put 'python-foo-expansion 'no-self-insert t)

;;   (define-abbrev python-mode-abbrev-table    ; abbrev table
;;                  "for"                       ; name
;;                  ""                          ; expansion
;;                  'python-foo-expansion)      ; expansion hook

;; Unfortunately, this is a lot of work to define what should be a
;; simple abbrev.  For convenience, this package provides a macro
;; `snippet-abbrev' that can be used with much less effort:

;;   (snippet-abbrev 'python-mode-abbrev-table            ; table
;;                   "for"                               ; name
;;                   "for $${element} in $${sequence}:") ; template

;; For even more convevience, when defining a lot of abbrevs in a
;; particular abbrev table, the package provides another macro
;; `snippet-with-abbrev-table':

;;   (snippet-with-abbrev-table 'python-mode-abbrev-table
;;     ("for" .  "for $${element} in $${sequence}:")
;;     ("im"  .  "import $$")
;;     ("if"  .  "if $${True}:")
;;     ("wh"  .  "while $${True}:"))

;; Be sure that the appropriate abbrev-table is loaded before using
;; the above otherwise you'll get an error.  I use the above in my
;; python-mode-hook.

;; Finally, for those running a recent version of Emacs, you can
;; disable snippet expansion in various parts of the buffer.  I use
;; this to disable the above "for" expansion while typing comments in
;; my python code.  Add the following line to your python-mode hook:

;;   (add-hook 'pre-abbrev-expand-hook
;;             (lambda ()
;;               (setq local-abbrev-table
;;                     (if (inside-comment-p)
;;                         text-mode-abbrev-table
;;                       python-mode-abbrev-table)))
;;             nil t)))

;;; Implementation Notes:

;; This is my first significant chunk of elisp code.  I have very
;; little experience coding with elisp; however, I have tried to
;; document the code for anyone trying to follow along.  Here are some
;; brief notes on the implementation.

;; When a snippet is inserted, the entire template of text has an
;; overlay applied.  This overlay is referred to as the "bound"
;; overlay in the code.  It is used to bold-face the snippet as well
;; as provide the keymap that is used while the point is located
;; within the snippet (so users can tab between fields).  This overlay
;; is actually one character longer than the template.  The reason is
;; to make sure that our local keymap is still in effect when a user
;; is typing in a field that happens to be at the end of the
;; template.

;; In addition, for each field (denoted by snippet-field-identifier),
;; an overlay is created.  These overlays are used to provide the
;; highlighting of the field values, the location of where the point
;; should move when tab is pressed (the start of the overlay is used
;; for this purpose), as well as the hooks to delete the default value
;; if a user starts to type their own value (the modification hooks of
;; the overlay are used for this purpose).

;; Once the user has tabbed out of the snippet, all overlays are
;; deleted and the snippet then becomes normal text.  Moving the
;; cursor back into the snippet has no affect (the snippet is not
;; activated again).  The idea is that the snippet concept should get
;; out of the users way as quickly as possible.

;;; Comparisons to Other Packages

;; tempo.el
;;  - Template definition is very lispy (although powerful).  In
;;    contrast, snippets are simple strings with minimal syntax.
;;  - Template parameters can be prompted via minibuffer.  In
;;    contrast, snippets use overlays to visually cue the user for
;;    parameters.
;;  + Templates can be wrapped around regions of text.
;;

;;; Known Limitations:

;; - When one uses something like `dabbrev-expand', when the text is
;;   inserted, it blows away a lot of the snippet.  Not sure why yet.
;; - Using 'indent-according-to-mode' does not seem to behave well
;;   with Python mode.  I have no idea why, the overlays end up
;;   getting shifted around incorrectly.

;; previous line which is not a complete sentence. So I use "$;" which
;; has a ";" character at the end. This is exactly the character for
;; terminating a sentence in c/c++. Thus the "}" can indent correctly.
;; But this is only a solution for c/c++. If other languages have
;; similar problems, it won't be easy to fix it. So a better way is
;; to rewrite the `snippet-insert' function in snippet.el so that it
;; removes the "$." character before it begins to do indentation (or
;; it just never insert it).

(defun snippet-split-regexp ()

(defun snippet-insert (template)
  "Insert a snippet into the current buffer at point.
TEMPLATE is a string that may optionally contain fields which are
specified by `snippet-field-identifier'.  Fields may optionally also
include default values delimited by `snippet-field-default-beg-char'
and `snippet-field-default-end-char'.

For example, the following template specifies two fields which have
the default values of \"element\" and \"sequence\":

  \"for $${element} in $${sequence}:\"

In the next example, only one field is specified and no default has
been provided:

  \"import $$\"

This function may be called interactively, in which case, the TEMPLATE
is prompted for.  However, users do not typically invoke this function
interactively, rather it is most often called as part of an abbrev
expansion.  See `snippet-abbrev' and `snippet-with-abbrev-table' for
more information."
